Introduction:

In a galaxy far, far away, the Jedi Order stands as the guardian of peace and justice.
At the heart of the Order lies the Jedi Temple,
where younglings from across the galaxy come to begin their journey toward becoming 
Jedi. You are one of these younglings, chosen for your potential and sensitivity to the 
Force. Your journey will be filled with trials that test your memory, agility, and wisdom. 
Only by passing these trials will you ascend through the ranks and achieve the revered 
status of Jedi Master.




Level 1: The Trial of Memory (Youngling to Padawan)

The journey begins in the serene Hall of Knowledge within the Jedi Temple. 
Statues of ancient Jedi Masters line the walls, and the air is filled with a sense 
of history and wisdom.

As a youngling, your first trial is designed to test your memory and your connection to 
the Force. Grand Master Yoda himself oversees this trial, encouraging you to focus and 
trust in your instincts.

Objective:
You will face a series of holocron memory puzzles. Each puzzle presents a grid of 
images that briefly reveals itself before shuffling. 
Your task is to match the pairs of images, which depict various elements of the 
Star Wars universe, such as planets, characters, and starships.

Completion:
Upon successfully completing the memory game, Grand Master Yoda smiles approvingly. 
"Strong in the Force, you are. Ready for the next step, you have become." 
You are now promoted to the rank of Padawan.




Level 2: The Trial of Agility (Padawan to Jedi Knight)
Setting:
As a Padawan, you move to the Training Grounds, an expansive area filled with various 
training droids and obstacles designed to test physical and mental agility.

Your next trial is overseen by Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. He explains that this test will 
challenge your reflexes and ability to remain calm under pressure. The trial is 
inspired by the lessons learned from battling droids.

Objective:
You will engage in a game of Whack-a-Mole, but with a Star Wars twist. 
Training droids pop up from different spots, and you must quickly react and use your 
lightsaber to deactivate them. Speed and accuracy are crucial as the pace increases 
with each wave.

Completion:
After successfully completing the game, Master Obi-Wan nods approvingly. 
"You have done well, young Padawan. Your agility and focus are commendable. 
You have earned the title of Jedi Knight."




Level 3: The Trial of Wisdom (Jedi Knight to Jedi Master)
Setting:
Your final trial takes place in the Chamber of Reflection, a quiet and solemn place 
within the Temple. It is here that Jedi come to meditate and seek wisdom.

Story:
As a newly appointed Jedi Knight, your final trial is the most challenging. 
Master Mace Windu explains that this test will measure your wisdom and mastery of the 
Force. It is a test of mind and spirit, reflecting the Jedi's role as peacekeepers 
and scholars.

Objective:
You will face a Star Wars-themed version of Wordle. The game presents you with a 
series of mysterious words related to the Jedi and the broader Star Wars lore. 
You must decipher these words within a limited number of attempts, using hints 
provided by the Force.

Completion:
Upon solving the final word puzzle, Master Mace Windu congratulates you. 
"You have shown great wisdom and perseverance. You are now ready to take your 
place among the Jedi Masters." As you stand in the Chamber of Reflection, 
a sense of accomplishment fills you. You have completed your training and 
achieved the highest honor within the Jedi Order.

Epilogue:
As a Jedi Master, you are now entrusted with the responsibility to train future 
generations of Jedi and uphold the values of the Order. The journey was long and 
challenging, but you have proven yourself worthy. 

The Force will be with you, always.
