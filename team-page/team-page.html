              <p>As a key contributor to the Star Wars-themed Wordle game, "The Trial of Wisdom," i implemented the JavaScript code for this final challenge in the journey from Jedi Knight to Jedi Master. i developed the core game logic, managed game state, ensured a smooth user experience.
                  On a personal note, my favorite Star Wars character is Luke Skywalker. His journey from a farm boy to a legendary Jedi Knight is incredibly inspiring, highlighting the importance of resilience and self-belief.</p>
