A Star Wars-themed Hackathon Project

## Project Description
In a galaxy far, far away, the Jedi Order stands as the guardian of peace and justice.
At the heart of the Order lies the Jedi Temple, where younglings from across the 
galaxy come to begin their journey towards becoming a Jedi. You are one of these 
younglings, chosen for your potential and sensitivity to the Force. Your journey will be 
filled with trials that test your memory, agility, and wisdom.
Only by passing these trials will you ascend through the ranks and achieve the revered
status of Jedi Master.

Throughout this game, you will embark on a Star Wars themed journey with a story and featuring a range of mini-games which include a memory game, Whack-a-mole, and a Star Wars themed Wordle. Each part of the story leads to a mini-game. The journey starts of being a youngling and then in order to become a Padawan you have a complete a game to test your memory at level 1 called "The Trial of Memory". The next part of the story at level 2 is called "The Trial of Agility" and this is to turn a Padawan into a Jedi Knight, the game here is Whack-a-droid. The final part of the game at level 3 is to turn a Jedi Knight to a Jedi Master and in order to complete this you have to take part in a game called "The Trial of Wisdom" which is a Star Wars themed Wordle game.

May the force be with you, as always!

### Documentation for Code
For the basic layout of the keyboard for Wordle we used [Wordle Keyboard](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-a-wordle-clone-in-javascript/) for the keyboard.
For help with building the Wordle game we used [Wordle Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckjRsPaWHX8)
