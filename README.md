# Jedi Academy - A Star Wars Story

A Star Wars-themed Hackathon Project

## Project Description

In a galaxy far, far away, the Jedi Order stands as the guardian of peace and justice.
At the heart of the Order lies the Jedi Temple, where younglings from across the
galaxy come to begin their journey towards becoming a Jedi. You are one of these
younglings, chosen for your potential and sensitivity to the Force. Your journey will be
filled with trials that test your memory, agility, and wisdom.
What rank you acheive will be determined by how well you do in these trials.

Throughout this game, you will embark on a Star Wars themed journey with a story featuring a range of mini-games which include a memory game, Whack-a-droid, and a Star Wars themed Wordle. As you enter the Jedi temple as a youngling, you will be faced with three tasks. "The Trial of Memory", "The Trial of Agility" and "The Trial of Wisdom". Each game has its own scoring criteria. Based on your performance, you will achieve either the rank of Padawan, Jedi Knight or Jedi Master. Once all trials have been completed, you will be awarded an overall rank as you graduate from the Jedi Academy.

"May the force be with you, always!"
